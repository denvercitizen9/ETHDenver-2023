#### WTF is OpenQ?
A hackathon payment platform for distributing pre-paid bounties.  You don't use the platform directly, but you need to make a commit on GitHub.
 - All ETHDenver Track Prizes will be paid through OpenQ
 - Most Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by ETHDenver through OpenQ
 - Some Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by the Sponsors directly

# DC9's ETHDenver 2023 Bounty Submission Guide  

### Step 1: Create Your Submission File

You can create a file using [OpenQ's official docs](https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission/pull-request-your-project-submission#create-your-submission-as-a-new-file) or copy [my template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denvercitizen9/ETHDenver-2023/main/PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md).  Note that you'll have to change the file name.  In my case, **PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md** became **JankaScore_denvercitizen9.md**

You can create this file in your own repo after Forking the SporkDAOOfficial GitHub, or you can follow OpenQ's instructions and use the UI to do the same thing.  Note that you'll need your own new branch, because you won't be able to create a PR for main.  I chose violence and named my branch 'therearesomanystepstoclaimabounty'

However you create the file, you'll see it contains a list of self-explanatory comments; fill out your info.

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request for Your File

If you've created a fork you can go [here](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/compare/main...SporkDAOOfficial:ETHDenver-2023:main) and select 'compare across forks' to identify your fork.  

### Step 3: Link Your Pull Request to the Bounties You Won
With your Pull request submitted you'll need to add a comment to your PR.

First you'll need to [search for your bounty which exists as an issue](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues).  For example, my team got third place for Best Use of Existing Subgraph, which is [issue #17](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues/17)

Once you have your issue # you'll be able to follow the process on the [OpenQ Docs](https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission/pull-request-your-project-submission#link-your-pull-request-to-the-bounties-you-won)

### Step 4: I've heard there are rumors of more things which you will need to do, like KYC
I'll update once I have more info.
