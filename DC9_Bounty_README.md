# DC9's Guide to ETHDenver 2023 Bounty Payments 

Congradulations to all the winners!  I put this together to help navigate the claim process.

**NOTICE: This is NOT an official guide.**  
If you have any questions you'll want to use ETHDenver's Discord/Articles and OpenQ's documentation, but I am sharing my experience in case it is helpful for you.

This repository is a fork of the official repo with 3 additional files in the root of the repo:
1. The .md file you are currently reading
2. A [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denvercitizen9/ETHDenver-2023/main/PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md) that you can use for your bounty payment submission
3. My actual bounty payment submission, which you can ignore

#### WTF is OpenQ?
A hackathon payment platform for distributing pre-paid bounties.  TBD if you will need to interact with another system but you will need to make a commit on GitHub.  Note that:
 - All ETHDenver Track Prizes will be paid through OpenQ
 - Most Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by ETHDenver through OpenQ
 - Some Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by the Sponsors directly (and you will need to work with them directly)
Note that ETHDenver is providing sponsor-specific updates at the end of the [ETHDenver Bounty Article](https://ethereumdenver.medium.com/ethdenver-2023-track-and-bounty-winners-1d9cbeda1dc8) so you can check that to see the status of your bounty.

# HOW TO GET PAID

### Step 1: Identify the GitHub Issue # for your Winning Bounties
The first thing you'll want to do is [search for your bounty and identify the issue number for your bounty](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues).  

For example, my team got third place for [Best Use of Existing Subgraph](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues/17).  You will need to find the correct issue # for each of the bounties that you won.  Remember the issue number(s) for each bounty that you won, you will need them for Step 4.

### Step 2: Create Your Submission File

You can create this file in your own repo after Forking the SporkDAOOfficial GitHub, or you can follow [OpenQ's official docs] and use the UI to do the same thing.  

I've incldued a [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denvercitizen9/ETHDenver-2023/main/PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md) that you can use as a starting point.  Note that you'll need your own new branch, because you won't be able to create a PR for main.  I chose violence and named my branch 'therearesomanystepstoclaimabounty'

However you create the file, you'll see that the file contains a list of self-explanatory comments; fill out your info and save the file.  You will need to change the file name.  In my case, **PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md** became **JankaScore_denvercitizen9.md** - this is the only file that you need for submission.

### Step 3: Create a Pull Request for Your File

Once you've created a fork you can [go here to start a merge request](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/compare/main...SporkDAOOfficial:ETHDenver-2023:main) and select 'compare across forks' to identify your fork (on the right side of the comparison) and submit your PR.  Your branch should only contain the file that you created in the previous step.

### Step 4: Link Your Pull Request to the Bounties You Won
After your Pull request is submitted you need to add a comment to your PR.  

Once you have your issue # (or #'s, you BAMF) you'll be able to follow the process on the [OpenQ Docs](https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission/pull-request-your-project-submission#link-your-pull-request-to-the-bounties-you-won) to add the comment to your PR.  Although some of you may know GitHub will recognize such comments in the comment of the commit for the PR, I woulds still recommend following the instructions to avoid any reasons for delays.

### Step 5: I've heard there are rumors of more steps
I'll update once I have more info.  I haven't received the email with instructions yet, but KYC is likely and I suspect there's another website you need to go to for that.  In any case, you can complete these steps now.
