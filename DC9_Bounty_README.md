#### WTF is OpenQ?
A hackathon payment platform for distributing pre-paid bounties.  To use it you will need to make a commit on GitHub.
 - All ETHDenver Track Prizes will be paid through OpenQ
 - Most Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by ETHDenver through OpenQ
 - Some Sponsor Bounty Prizes will be paid by the Sponsors directly (and you will need to work with them directly)

# HOW TO GET PAID

### Step 1: Identify the GitHub Issue # for your Winning Bounties
The first thing you'll want to do is [search for your bounty which exists as an issue](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues).  

For example, my team got third place for [Best Use of Existing Subgraph](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/issues/17).  You will need to find the correct issue # for each of the bounties that you won.  Remember the issue number(s) for each bounty that you won, you will need them for Step 4.

### Step 2: Create Your Submission File

You can create a file using [OpenQ's official docs](https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission/pull-request-your-project-submission#create-your-submission-as-a-new-file) or copy [my template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denvercitizen9/ETHDenver-2023/main/PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md).  Note that you'll have to change the file name.  In my case, **PROJECT_NAME_YOUR_NAME.md** became **JankaScore_denvercitizen9.md**

You can create this file in your own repo after Forking the SporkDAOOfficial GitHub, or you can follow OpenQ's instructions and use the UI to do the same thing.  Note that you'll need your own new branch, because you won't be able to create a PR for main.  I chose violence and named my branch 'therearesomanystepstoclaimabounty'

However you create the file, you'll see it contains a list of self-explanatory comments; fill out your info.

### Step 3: Create a Pull Request for Your File

Once you've created a fork you can go [here](https://github.com/SporkDAOOfficial/ETHDenver-2023/compare/main...SporkDAOOfficial:ETHDenver-2023:main) and select 'compare across forks' to identify your fork (on the right side) and submit your PR.  Your branch should only contain the file that you created in the previous step.

### Step 4: Link Your Pull Request to the Bounties You Won
With your Pull request submitted you'll need to add a comment to your PR.  

Once you have your issue # (or #'s, if you're a BAMF) you'll be able to follow the process on the [OpenQ Docs](https://docs.openq.dev/hackathon-winner/project-submission/pull-request-your-project-submission#link-your-pull-request-to-the-bounties-you-won) to add the comment to your PR.  Although GitHub will recognize such comments in the comment of the commit for the PR, I woulds still recommend following the instructions because this is how they want it and you want to avoid any reasons for delays.

### Step 5: I've heard there are rumors of more things which you will need to do
I'll update once I have more info.  I haven't received the email with instructions yet, but I thought I heard something about KYC.
